Write a numbered list of exactly 10 (no more, no less) of the most well-known microcontroller architectures (specifically microcontroller architectures, not processor architectures).

For each item in the list, in addition to the name of the microcontroller architecture, include the date when this architecture was introduced.

Specify which company or person invented the architecture.

Indicate the available bit-width variants for this architecture.

For each item, specify the number of chips produced with this architecture.

Also, for each item, provide the names of five specific well-known models of electrical devices that use a microcontroller with this architecture.

Mention the most powerful chip released based on this architecture. Specify its technical characteristics, primarily its clock frequency and manufacturing process.

The list should be sorted by year, i.e., the architecture that appeared earliest should be at the beginning of the list, and the architecture that appeared latest should be at the end of the list.

Here's an example of how each item should look:
